# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Assignment 2 - Visualisation

---

**This is an individual assignment. No discussion of the assignment with others or any other collaboration is allowed.**

This assignment (which will be marked!) is about visualising data. In Exercises 1-3, the task is to replicate three plots about different topics as closely as possible using `ggplot2`. Do not worry if you cannot replicate the plots 100%, the main purpose of this assignment is to learn more about visualisation in R. Trying to replicate plots is an excellent way to do this. In the Exercise 4, the goal is then to develop own `ggplot2` or `plotly` visualisations.

You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom. Remember that it will be graded based on the compiled/knitted RMarkdown file in `.html` format. **Submissions without an `.html` file will receive 20 points penalty.**

**Deadline:** Friday, 28 October 2022, 2pm (London time).
