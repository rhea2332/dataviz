# Feedback and grades

This file will contain feedback to your submission and the points assigned to each exercise.

| Exercise | Grade | Feedback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 11/12     | Need to indicate x axis is logged in the label
| 2 | 28/28     |
| 3 | 36/60     | Nice job explaining what you are doing step by step and by using multiple Wikipedia page data. The final plot could be improved by overlaying the points on a map of Geneva and by changing the color scale to make it easier to discern between higher and lower elevations. The mp4 was very cool, but also would have been improved being overtop a map of Geneva. The other thing to have pushed this further would be to have a more distinct research question -- why do you want to visualize the elevation of Geneva? Is there something that the elevation might impact that you could look at?
| Total | 75/100      |
